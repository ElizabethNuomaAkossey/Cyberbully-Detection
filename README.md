The most common platforms for cyberbullying incidents are social media platforms. Instagram records the highest rate of cyberbullying among other platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Tiktok(Ditch the Label). In 2023, it was estimated that approximately 4.9 billion people use social media globally(Forbes Advisor) and cyberbullying prevalence is on the rise.
A recent UNICEF cyberbullying poll conducted in 30 Sub-Saharan African countries, one in three respondents said they had been a victim of cyberbullying with one in five reporting having skipped school due to cyberbullying and violence.

Cyberbullyng can cause;
- Higher rates of depression and anxiety
- Reduced feelings of self-worth
- Increased suicide attempts


Detecting and addressing cyberbullying is a major issue faced by social media platforms and the incoporation of Machine learning techniques provides a robust solution.

## Project Objective

In order to provide a safer platform for users there is a need for an effective detection system that can automate the process of cyberbullying detections and take decisions.This NLP projects aims;
- to detect cyberbullying incidents,
- automatically classify new instances
- reduce investigation time and effort significantly.

## Data Description

The dataset includes various types of cyberbullying instances, such as race/ethnicity, gender/sexual, and religion-related content, as well as non-cyberbullying instances.

The dataset consists of a total of approximately 100,000 tweets collected from social media platforms. It is labeled with a multi-class classification approach, where each tweet falls into one of the following categories:

Non-cyberbullying: 50,000 instances Race/Ethnicity-related cyberbullying: 17,000 instances Gender/Sexual-related cyberbullying: 17,000 instances Religion-related cyberbullying: around 16,000 instances The dataset is balance ensures equal representation of each class, allowing for effective training and evaluation of cyberbully detection models.
